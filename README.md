The project **Manhattan Transfer: Computational Analysis of John Dos Passos's Novel** was developed by Alessandra Failla and Laura Travaglini for the course Digital Text in the Humanities as a part of the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge degree at University of Bologna.
The project consists of three sections providing different computational approaches for the analysis of the novel.

The **first** section covers the TEI-based encoding of the full text of Manhattan Transfer. A panoramic of the selected TEI elements are provided, as well as motivations for their choice.

The **second** section deals with the text analysis with Voyant Tools. A presentation and interpretation of the results are provided.

The **third** section presents a network analysis of the novel performed by extracting characters' interactions and the related centrality measures with Python and providing a visualization of the network with Gephi.
